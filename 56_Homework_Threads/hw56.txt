1. Update race such way that after finishing a race, results table should be displayed out in the following format (example data)
 place thread-number time
   1      3          256
   2      1          254
   3      2          254 

2. Write Printer thread class that prints a determined amount of its number (e.g. 100) by the portions .
Each portion shall contain a determined amount of the numbers (e.g. 10).
During printing one portion none from other threads shall  print
Output shall look like as follows
111111111111
22222222222
33333333333
……………….


Implementation note: Apply sleep/interrupt synchronization


3. Write PrinterController class with method main that configures and launches a determined number (e.g. 4) of the Printer threads. 


Implementation hints;
1. After launching all threads will sleep
2. Main thread interrupts the first thread
3. First thread prints a portion and interrupts second thread (it has the reference to the second thread)
4. Second interrupts third and so on. The last thread interrupts the first one. Thus there will be the chain of threads that should be set by the PrinterController
5. Threads finish after printing out all portions
